# Clothing-Fit-Size-Prediction
We are predicting the clothing fit size of the customers with respect to their clothing details using Machine Learning. 

# Introduction
Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customer's shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates.

These datasets obtained for ModCloth and RentTheRunway could be used to address the challenges in catlog size recommendations but 
to predict the quality of the cloth.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building and deployment on Heroku.
